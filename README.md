### Description

#### Summary

A command-line based applicaton which presents a user with a series of questions and generates a README.md file from user responses.

#### In Depth

This application is a command-line based application which presents a user with a series of 9 questions by utilizing the Inquirer v8.2.4 package. The first 8 questions require a user to input text and the last question is chosen from a list of options. Upon finishing the questions, a README.md file is created and written to a local folder, which can then be opened and edited by the user. 

### Installation

Using a terminal, navigate to the folder containing index.js and type node index.js and click enter. The terminal will then begin to ask the user a series of questions. 

### Usage

Since README.md files are such a vital part of repositories and applications, consistency when writing README.md files will help the devloper reach a wider audience.
